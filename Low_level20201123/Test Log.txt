  The serial buffer is defined in core head file '\\....\Arduino\hardware\Arduino_STM32\STM32F1\system\libmaple\include\libmaple\usart.h'.
  
  There may occurs data overflow in MCU recieve buffer if high-level control frequency does not match the low-leve control buffer

  When high-level controller is stopped with timer object delete, a stop command will be sent to MCU for low-level controller, but no guatantee measurement has be made that MCU can correctly receive this command: Potential measurement-Make sure the main program only stop when info package feedback turn to resume to a safe operation point

  Caution that before apply the control program, each sensor should be calibrated first

  To adjust sensor feedback item, both ADC config and sensor feedback info prcessing program should be adjusted simuteneously

  If cettain sensor info is needed for control, make sure it is obtained correctly with correct command

  The motor enable pin is disabled after initialization, and will be enabled when the 'mode' flag recieved from PC indicates normal operation

  To increase main-loop running speed, Enabled ADC channel can be adjusted. Notice in getADC() the ENABLED_CH & i just needed to be amended to actual channel number, but in getADCaverage(), ENABLED_CH & i do not need to change but t need to change coincide the order of ADC channel
