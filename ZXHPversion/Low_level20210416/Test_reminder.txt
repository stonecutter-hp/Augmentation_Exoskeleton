  IMU yaw angle set to zero retest   √

  Check if enum type can be used for if/else command from PC command recieving, i.e. (uint8_t)mode = 1 from recieving can lead to such a command (uint8_t)mode = (enum) status. 
  -- √ with a solution: Define another variable for PC command recieiving and then change the enum status accordingly to avoid format mixing
