    If the force sensor is connected to ADC channel 10/11/12/13/14/15, it may need extra resistance divider to make sure the measued voltage from force sensor range from 0 to 2.5v
    If extra resistors are connected to divide feedback voltage to 0~2.5v, the attaRatio vector defined in ADC.h should be adjusted accordingly
    Desired torque should be limited at: 0~limited torque

    Check if the communication protocol is coincided to communication program set up like: terminator, SendItemFlag set up.

    For low-level controller parameter adjustment, find it in Control.h #define part as the actuation unit parameter is the same for different subjects.
    For high-level controller parameter adjustment, find it in Control.ccpp HLControl_Init() as the parameter is different for different subjects.
    Notice to check the Initial value like ForceSensorL_InitValue, HipAngR_InitValue is ADC raw data or Processed data
    Remember to record expected initial value of every sensor before practical application of the control program

    Make sure the relationship ThighAngle + TrunkAngle = Hip Joint is satisfied from both software and hardware aspect

    Next time before programming, plan the code configuration first !

    Notice Yaw angle will be reset to zero if last time trigger event others --> Standing is detected if yawAngleR20() is place before HLControl() to leave one cycle time for subject to full standing.
    Therefore, Yaw angle will be reset to zero immediately if this time trigger event others --> Standing is detected if yawAngleR20() is place after HLControl(). And only reset once for each event detection.
    HLsensorFeedbackPro() should be connected directly with HLcontrol() and senData() without more processing of sensor feedback to guarantee the real-time of sensor info.

    If velocity is calculated in MCU, attention that the real ADC feedback update frequency is not identically to the setted value in the program
