    If the force sensor is connected to ADC channel 10/11/12/13/14/15, it may need extra resistance divider to make sure the measued voltage from force sensor range from 0 to 2.5v
    If extra resistors are connected to divide feedback voltage to 0~2.5v, the attaRatio vector defined in ADC.h should be adjusted accordingly
    Desired torque should be limited at: 0~limited torque

    Check if the communication protocol is coincided to communication program set up like: terminator, SendItemFlag set up.

    For low-level controller parameter adjustment, find it in Control.h #define part as the actuation unit parameter is the same for different subjects.
    For high-level controller parameter adjustment, find it in Control.ccpp HLControl_Init() as the parameter is different for different subjects.
    Notice to check the Initial value like ForceSensorL_InitValue, HipAngR_InitValue is ADC raw data or Processed data
    Remember to record expected initial value of every sensor before practical application of the control program

    Make sure the relationship ThighAngle + TrunkAngle = Hip Joint is satisfied from both software and hardware aspect
