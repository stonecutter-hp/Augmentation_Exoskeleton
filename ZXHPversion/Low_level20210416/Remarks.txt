    If the force sensor is connected to ADC channel 10/11/12/13/14/15, it may need extra resistance divider to make sure the measued voltage from force sensor range from 0 to 2.5v
    If extra resistors are connected to divide feedback voltage to 0~2.5v, the attaRatio vector defined in ADC.h should be adjusted accordingly
    Desired torque should be limited at: 0~limited torque
