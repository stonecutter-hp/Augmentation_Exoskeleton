For PC High-level controller:
  Setup all the control parameters 
  --> Configure Timer 
  --> As Timer is started, the Serial Port is configured and opened in StartFcn of the Timer. Meanwhile, the program running time is recorded from this stage with 'tic' command
  --> Before call functional functions in TimeCallback Fcn, the time of calling TimeCallback is recorded with 'toc' command
  --> Inside TimeCallback Fcn, First functional function is to receive data from MCU: Read data from MCU: With enabling flag of delay info package feedback detection: True - Enable next Control and Command Sending program as long as info package from MCU is correctly received; False - Detect if the info package is real-time or not, if it is, enable Control and Command Sending, if it is not, wait until real-time pacakge is received or delay receiving cycle exceed maximum allowable cycles P.MaxDelay -> Decomposite data
  --> Control.m for motion detection and reference torque generation
  --> Send_Data for data sending for PC to MCU
  --> Check if running time is exceed maximum allowable time, if it is, then stop timer
  --> When stop timer for high-level controller, timer object is deleted; Stop command for low-level controller is sended; Stop and delete PC Serial port object; finally saving experiment data.


For MCU Low-level controller:
  Set all the control parameters
  --> Sensor pre process to reset at expected initial position for sensor feedback initial value setup
  --> Get info package from High-level controller(If received, update information, if not received, continue next step) 
  --> Get ADC and IMU feedback 
  --> Yaw angle set to zero 
  --> Sensor feedback processing: -> Motor status update -> Torsion spring torque feedback update -> Trunk angle&velocity and hip angle feedback update -> Cable torque feedback update -> Compact assistive torque feedback calculation -> Phase index update
  --> Low level Control based on the compact assistive torque feedback
  --> Send info package to PC
