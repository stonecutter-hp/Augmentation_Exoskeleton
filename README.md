# Back-Support Exoskeleton Control Program
## Content
Updated control programs for two versions of back-support exoskeleton: <br>
> One is a back-support exoskeleton with novel cable-driven series parallel elastic actuation system; <br>
> Another is a back-support exoskeleton with high power direct-driven system.


## Overall Description of Present Prototype

### HCHP version
#### Actuation system
> Cable-driven series elastic actuation system <br>
#### Characteristics

#### Control Hardware
> MATLAB on PC (high-level); Ardunio-STM32F1 (low-level) <br>

### ZXHP version: <br>
#### Actuation system
> Direct-driven actuator from previous exoskeleton <br>
#### Characteristics
> Independent hip joint torque control; <br>
> Multi-posture supportive including stoop, squat, semi-squat and step standing bending.
#### Control Hardware
> Ardunio-STM32F1 (high-level+low-level)
